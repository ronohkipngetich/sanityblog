## NextJS Blog Starter Template For Free ðŸ’¯


This is a starter blog template created with next.js - a react framework and sanity as a backend tool. It also includes comment section. The design is inspired by [Sonny Sangha](https://www.youtube.com/c/SonnySangha). The website is completely Open Source, you can use it for whatever purpose you want.
